#MNIST data in Genie format.
MNIST handwritten digits data set in Genie Digestible Format (GDF) for use by genies.

The mnist-1.gdz and mnist-2.gdz files are pre-converted zip files, ready to upload to your genie's bottle.  Each contains half of the full MNIST data set.

Use the bottle's Backtesting platform to upload the files.  After uploading, select both files for testing.

The original 'training set' and 'test set' are combined.  Let your genie's bottle handle the random separation and assignments of training and test sets.
